    <h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>A Data-Driven Exploration of the Race between Man and Machine</em></strong></h5> </br>
        <p style="text-align: right;">“If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.” </p>
        <p style="text-align: right;">-	Peter Drucker</p>
Anxiety about automation is prevalent in this era of rapid technological advances especially in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. Although there have been doom-laden prophecies about new technology and automation replacing human tasks and wiping out a large number of jobs at least since the Industrial Revolution two centuries ago, recent technological advances in performing sophisticated and complex tasks differentiate the 21st century from previous ones.</br></br>

Given that technology directly affects the demand for specific skills and tasks, instead of acting on whole occupations, the impacts of automation technology vary widely by task types. Thus, it is imperative to examine the types of tasks that are more, or less, susceptible to technological advances; as Peter Drucker stated, “proper measurement of information will lead to advances in effectiveness and performance of management.” To this end, we initiated this research project to empirically explore the evolution of task automation during 2007-2019.</br></br>

For a data-driven exploration of the race between human tasks (man) and automation technology (machine), we propose a network-based methodology that reveals the latent task types across occupations. We then measure the task-level degree of automation and evaluate task complementarity, or substitutability, with the demands for occupations in which such a task is performed.</br></br>

As consistent with prior studies, it reveals the inverted-U shaped relationship between degree of automation and required level of education at the task level. </br></br>

To examine the dynamics of technical advances and labor demands in the 21st century, the revealed task types are classified into distinct categories according to the changes in degree of automation and labor demand during 2007-2019. </br></br>

<div class="small text-muted">The size is proportional to the degree of automation in 2019. The black dots represent statistically insignificant change in labor demand.</div></br></br>

<ul>
<li> Race with the Machine: Tasks have already been highly automated or have experienced in the increase in automation level, but the labor demand for the tasks has increased from 2007 to 2019 </li>
<li> Race against the Machine: Tasks have already been highly automated or have experienced in the increase in automation level, and the labor demand for the tasks has decreased from 2007 to 2019 </li>
<li> Race ahead of the Machine: Tasks have experienced in the decrease in automation level, and the labor demand for the tasks has increased from 2007 to 2019 </li>
<li> Running a Different Race: Tasks have experienced in the increase in degree of automation, but the labor demand for the tasks has remained stable during 2007-2019 </li>
</ul>


Based on our analysis, we provide the online system of job automation index that illustrates the task-level susceptibility to automation across occupations and cities in the United States. The task-level decomposition of automation level will provide a more granular understanding of how technical advances and automation affect occupations and communities, which informs further research and policy discussions on the societal challenges of automation and the future of work.</br></br>
This system consists of five functions, the first three of which are at occupation level and the last two at city level:</br></br>
